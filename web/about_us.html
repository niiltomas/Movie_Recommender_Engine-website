        <h1>About us</h1>
        
        <p>
            This website was created by Nil Tom√†s Plans, a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering with a focus on Data Science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The main objective behind this project was to learn the fundamentals of data processing, file conversions (from .csv to .json), implementing basic algorithms, and gaining experience with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
            Using AI tools, I developed this website to recommend movies to users based on various criteria. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The site is built with an easy-to-navigate interface, where users can sort and explore movies by rating, popularity, and release year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the first moment the idea was to do a recommender engine that could adapt to the user needs.
            However, due to time-limitations this implementation could not be done, and had to be posponed.
